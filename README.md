## About Dataset
The dataset (WPP2024_Demographic_Indicators_Medium (1).csv) was downloaded from United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division. [link](https://population.un.org/wpp/downloads?folder=Standard%20Projections&group=CSV%20format)

## üîç Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth demographic analysis comparing **India** and **South Korea** using United Nations population data spanning from **1950 to 2025**. The analysis explores critical demographic indicators including fertility rates, life expectancy, dependency ratios, population structure, and migration patterns to understand the contrasting demographic trajectories of these two nations.

The study particularly highlights South Korea's emerging population decline crisis and contrasts it with India's demographic dividend phase.

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze demographic trends across 75 years of UN population data
- Compare population dynamics between a developing nation (India) and a developed nation (South Korea)
- Identify key indicators of population decline and demographic transition
- Visualize critical demographic shifts and their implications
- Forecast future demographic trends using machine learning models

## üî¨ Key Findings

### South Korea's Demographic Crisis Indicators

#### 1. **Critical Fertility Rate Decline**
- South Korea's fertility rate has plummeted to approximately **0.75 in 2020**
- This is significantly below the replacement rate of 2.1 needed for population stability
- Represents one of the world's lowest fertility rates

#### 2. **Aging Population Structure**
- Elderly population now nearly equals working-age population (post-2020)
- Optimal structure: 60-70% working-age, <20% elderly
- South Korea shows severe deviation from this ideal

#### 3. **Elevated Elderly Dependency Ratio (EDR)**
- EDR has surged to **45%** after 2000
- Healthy EDR threshold: <30%
- Indicates unsustainable burden on working population

#### 4. **Median Age Crisis**
- Median age has exceeded **45 years**
- Optimal range: 30-40 years
- Indicates critically aging population with insufficient youth

#### 5. **Negative Population Growth**
- Both normalized natural change and total population change are **negative**
- Indicates sustained population decline despite migration
- Population naturally shrinking due to low births and aging population

### India vs South Korea Comparison

#### **Demographic Advantage - India**
- Fertility rate closer to replacement level
- Lower elderly dependency ratio (5x lower than South Korea in 2025)
- More balanced age structure
- Positive population growth trends

#### **Migration Patterns**
- **South Korea**: Net immigration in 21st century (AI/tech hub attraction)
- **India**: Net emigration (brain drain to developed nations)

## üìä Technical Implementation

## üö® Critical Implications

### For South Korea
- **Economic Impact**: Shrinking workforce, increased healthcare costs
- **Social Security**: Unsustainable pension and healthcare systems
- **Innovation Risk**: Reduced human capital for technological advancement
- **Cultural Continuity**: Risk to cultural preservation and transmission

### Global Significance
- South Korea represents a cautionary tale for other developed nations
- Demonstrates the rapid pace of demographic transition
- Highlights the importance of proactive population policies

## üîÆ Future Projections

Using machine learning models, the project forecasts continued demographic challenges for South Korea, including:
- Further fertility rate decline
- Accelerated population aging
- Increased dependency ratios
- Potential economic and social sustainability risks
